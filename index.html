            <p class="blog-post-meta">December 24, 2017</p>
            <p>I have heard a lot of stories of how people got into coding and have started careers in web development. In particular, I know many people who started coding from a very young age like 5 or 6 years old. For me, as a kid growing up in the millenial/Google generation. I didn't have a formal coding education or background. In fact, I became interested in coding when I least expected it. My first exposure to coding didn't come until my senior year at the University of Minnesota. It was really by accident that I discovered a passion for learning how to code.</p>

            <p>In 2013, I was finishing up my Bachelor's degree in Scientific and Technical Communication, and the final course I needed to complete my degree was an introduction to web design course. I initially took the course thinking it would be an easy course that I needed before I could graduate. At the time, I didn't think of myself much as a web developer or designer. When I started the course, I knew very little about front end development. By the end of the course, I had created my very first website, which was a portfolio I used to display some of my writing projects.</p>

            <p>After completing the course, I realized how much fun it was to build and design a website. That course gave me a basic understanding of what front end development is, gave me an understanding of web design best practices, and challenged me to dig deeper into web development. However, after graduation, the excitement and appreciation I had for web development gradually became smaller and smaller over the years. I really did try to push myself to learn more advanced topics by reading through books and taking online courses, but life quickly became busy. After college, I moved to New Hampshire where I started my career as a technical writer, and learning how to code became less of a priority. As years went by, I started to lose interest in coding.</p>
           
            <p>In December of 2017, I decided to move back to Minnesota where I grew up, and that's when I started to ask myself questions. How did I lose interest in coding? What went wrong? After being away from coding for so long, I started to wonder what would it take to find my inner coding mojo again.</p>

            <p>In August of 2017, I started looking for ways to get back into coding. I started looking at different online and in-person courses I could take. I also started looking at different books I could read. After much research, I decided to enroll in the University of Minnsota coding bootcamp. I started classes in November of 2017, and so far, it has been one of the best experiences of my life. The coding bootcamp really rejuvenated a love for coding and web design that I almost lost. Although I had previous coding experience (mainly HTML and CSS), the bootcamp has been nothing but easy for me. But, that's what I love about coding. I like challenging myself. I like exploring new technologies. I like tinkering with CSS and trying to understand the mysteries of Javascript. There's never a dull moment when learning how to code.

            <p>Since starting the coding bootcamp, I have regained my passion for web design and development and have not looked back since. Learning to code takes determination, and that's why I enrolled in a coding bootcamp. So far, the coding bootcamp has given me the skills and confidence I need to start a career in web development. It has given me the motivation to start and finish my own coding projects. I am truly excited to be coding again. As a result, I started this blog to share my story in hopes of helping others who want to learn how to code but are struggling with finding their coding mojo. From building my first website to enrolling in a coding bootcamp to designing web applications to starting this blog, I have gotten my mojo back. Going forward, I'll do everything I can to make sure I won't lose it again.</p>
